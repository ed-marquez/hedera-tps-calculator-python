# Hedera Transactions Per Second (TPS) Calculation

This Python script (also provided in JavaScript - [see repo](https://github.com/ed-marquez/hedera-tps-calculator-js)) calculates the Transactions Per Second (TPS) for Hedera by analyzing data from the last few blocks.

## 1. Fetch Block Data

Every block on Hedera takes approximately 2 seconds. In our script, we're focusing on the last 5 blocks:
Data for the last 5 blocks is retrieved using Hedera's mirror node REST API:

```python
import requests

def get_transactions_per_second():

    numBlocks = 5
    blocks_url = f"https://mainnet-public.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/blocks?limit={numBlocks}"
    response = requests.get(blocks_url)
```

## 2. Add Up Transactions

For these 5 blocks, the total number of transactions is calculated by summing up the transaction counts of each block:

```python
    blocks = response.json()['blocks']
    sum_of_transactions = sum(block['count'] for block in blocks)
```

## 3. Calculate Duration

We determine the total duration of these 5 blocks by calculating the difference between the timestamps of the newest and the oldest block:

```python
    newest_block_to_timestamp = float(blocks[0]['timestamp']['to'])
    oldest_block_from_timestamp = float(blocks[-1]['timestamp']['from'])
    duration = newest_block_to_timestamp - oldest_block_from_timestamp
```

## 4. Calculate TPS 🎉🎉

The TPS is simply the **total number of transactions** in the last 5 blocks (approximately 10 seconds) divided by the **actual duration of those blocks**.

```python
    transactions_per_second = sum_of_transactions / duration
    return transactions_per_second
```

# See the Results!

Simply run the script:

```python
TPS = get_transactions_per_second()
print(f"Hedera TPS:", TPS)
```
